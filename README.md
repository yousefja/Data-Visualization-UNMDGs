# Data-Visualization-UNMDGs
 Using Tableau to visualize data from the UN MDG dataset
 
 Thoughts on specific visualizations:
 
   1. 'Reducing Child Mortality'
   
       This Tableau Dashboard provides information on global trends in reduction of child mortality rates. In the upper left of the Dashboard, it can be observed that child mortality rates have declined between 1973 and 2007 across the world. With each blue dot per column representing one nation in that year, it is especially apparent in later years that the highest density of mortality rates lie between 0 and 0.05. To the right of this chart, we see that in 2007, the global child mortality rates are quite low, with the exception of some nations in sub-saharan Africa. In trying to understand what might be affecting some of these difficulties, we can use (with caution) the Pearson correlation analysis below, demonstrating some UN Indicators with a high correlation (not causation) to child mortality rates. A further breakdown of these specific indicators measured for nations with the highest and lowest child mortality rates might offer some more concrete evidence for the need to address these indicators in order to reduce mortality rates. 
 
   2. 'Urbanization' (Screenshot of Animation)
       
       This animation allows us to view the growth of urban populations around the world. It allows us to compare regions as well as specific countries. For example, we can see that the America's, Europe, and the British Commonwealth (ie Australia, New Zealand) show higher levels of urban population as a percent of the total population when compared to nations in Africa and Asia. For future visuaizations, it might be interesting to see what other UN Indicators are correlated to urban population and compare these across most and least urbanized nations/regions.
       
   3. 'Tracking GDP Over Time'
       
       CAUTION: This line graph shows the growth in GDP among the 15 highest GDP nations. This should not be considered a measure of the wealthiest nations in the world as GDP has flaws as a metric in this case (https://ethical.net/politics/gdp-alternatives-7-ways-to-measure-countries-wealth/)
       
       More accurately, this graph demonstrates the value (in US Dolaars) of all goods and services produced by the nations represented from 1972 to 2007. It can help us in determining economic health, but what might be more interesting to measure, and perhaps more in line with what the UN MDGs are aiming for, would be the welfare and overall well-being of the country's population. It would be interesting to see how the GDP of these nations correlates with other metrics of wealth: clean air, health, life span, gender equality, opportunity, education (Andester, ethical.net). It would also be interesting to compare these same metrics in countries with the lowest GDPs.
