# Data-Visualization-UNMDGs
 Using Tableau to visualize data from the UN MDG dataset
 
 Thoughts on specific visualizations:
 
   1. 'Urbanization' 
       This animation allows us to view the growth of urban populations around the world. It allows us to compare regions as well as specific countries. For example, we can see that the America's, Europe, and the British Commonwealth (ie Australia, New Zealand) show higher levels of urban population as a percent of the total population when compared to nations in Africa and Asia. For future visuaizations, it might be interesting to see what other UN Indicators are correlated to urban population and compare these across most and least urbanized nations/regions.
       
   2. 'Tracking GDP Over Time'
       CAUTION: This line graph shows the growth in GDP among the 15 highest GDP nations. This should not be considered a measure of the wealthiest nations in the world as GDP has flaws as a metric in this case (https://ethical.net/politics/gdp-alternatives-7-ways-to-measure-countries-wealth/)
       
       More accurately, this graph demonstrates the value (in US Dolaars) of all goods and services produced by the nations represented from 1972 to 2007. It can help us in determining economic health, but what might be more interesting to measure, and perhaps more in line with what the UN MDGs are aiming for, would be the welfare and overall well-being of the country's population. It would be interesting to see how the GDP of these nations correlates with other metrics of wealth: clean air, health, life span, gender equality, opportunity, education (Andester, ethical.net). It would also be interesting to compare these same metrics in countries with the lowest GDPs.
